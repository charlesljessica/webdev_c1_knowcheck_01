            <h2>About Me</h2>

            <p>
                I'm a Cybersecurity student in my second year at Western Governors University, proudly holding a CompTIA A+ Certification. I'm diving into web development through Code Kentucky and Codecademy, bringing a mix of skills to the table. With a background as a Behavior technician, problem-solving is my forte. As I transition into Web development and ultimately focus on Application Security, I bring with me a fusion of technical expertise, adaptability, and strong communication skills. Staying on top of emerging tech isn't just a commitment, it's a passion.
